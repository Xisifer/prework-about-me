      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Details here...</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Originally, I hail from Silicon Valley in the California Bay Area (specifically Redwood City). In 2011 I moved out to Austin to begin working
        in the video game industry, where I still am today.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Oh, plenty of things. Video games primarily, but gaming functions as more of a socialization tool and a way to keep in contact with friends 
        across the country, as well as a window and introduction to other hobbies 
        (such as Dungeons & Dragons) which then feed into yet other sub-hobbies (such as creative writing).
      In the realm of sports, I also enjoyed sport fencing and archery in college, I just haven't managed to find the spare time and/or finances and/or 
      commitment to seek out any classes for it yet.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job? </h1>
      <p>I'm no longer certain. When I was a teenager, I thought becoming a video game developer was my Dream Job, but 8 years of Quality Assurance 
        experience and a half-dozen game development studios later, I've discovered that the industry is not exactly the Wonka's Chocolate Factory I envisioned.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Austin, Sunset Valley area</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm seeking a career change away from the video game industry, and learning coding skills would serve me both in QA for general tech outside of gaming, 
        and also possibly serve as an entry point for Web Development, if I end up trying this out and discovering that I have a previously unknown aptitude for it.</p>
